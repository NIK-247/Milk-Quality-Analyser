# Milk-Quality-Analyser
A Milk Quality Analyzer checks factors such as fat and SNF (Solids Not Fat) content, but existing devices cost between 25,000 to 50,000, making them affordable only for those with milk societies or industries. To support basic dairy farmers, we propose designing a low-cost device. During field trips and conversations with farmers, we learned about Subclinical Mastitis, a deadly disease that shows no symptoms until it results in the death of cattle. Thus, we aim to create a device that can detect this disease in its early stages, helping to save the lives of cattle.
